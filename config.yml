      Bonjour! I'm a prospective university student. I've been programming
      for about 4 years (self taught). I know a fair bit about Python, though
      I'm spending a lot more time writing Go these days... I also did a bit
      of web development.

      You are probably wondering what is the difference between a post, an
      article and a project. Articles and projects are carefully crafted,
      whereas posts are pretty much just me thinking out loud...
