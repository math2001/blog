[Python](https://python.org) is by far my favorite language (I even wish we spoke it :smile:).

One thing I found funny about it, and in the same time really good, is [its
zen](https://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).

They're basically guidelines.

So, today, *dans un Ã©lan d'inspiration*, I decided to write my own. Here it is:

```
Keep it simple.
Lazyness is a quality.
Learn to use your tools efficiently.
Get inspired by great things.
Do one thing, and do it well.
Perfect programmers don't need comments.
But every user needs documentation.
```
