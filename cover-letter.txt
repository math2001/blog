I have a genuine passion for the things I do, improvement is what drives me.

I love programming, I've been teaching myself how to code for 4 years now. My most popular open source project is called MarkdownLivePreview, it's a Sublime Text plugin with over 100k installs (see on package control). I really enjoy how much there is to learn, and finding out about different ways of approaching different problems.

Lately, I've been really interested in thinking about concurrent programs thanks to a friend I met at the Canberra Python User Group. He showed me the python library called trio. The concept of nursery really felt like a revelation to me, and I wrote the start a game server using this concept (github.com/math2001/nine43). I would love to discuss the structure of this program more in depth.

I love physics and couldn't accept that my knowledge about this topic at the end of year 12 would would be all I ever knew, so I decided to keep studying physics at university (double degree).

I really enjoy running, and have evolved from coming 15th at my school cross country in year 9 to making it to state in year 12.

I'm French, we moved to Australia with my family to learn to speak English fluently. I'll let you be the judge of the reminiscent of my accent :)

I really enjoy sharing what I know too, and I'm really looking forward to working extensively on problems with other people (we lived in a rural area, and I was the only one programming somewhat seriously). Nonetheless, I tutored French for 2 years in high school, and I'm now tutoring physics in Sydney.

This paints a more precise picture of my character than what my CV does, though there wasn't much room for modesty :)
