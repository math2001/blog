      <description>Motions If you studied physics, one of the first things you probably did was graph the &amp;ldquo;motion&amp;rdquo; of objects. That is the displacement, velocity, and acceleration at an instant t.
Observation Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have an object whos displacement is such that:
$$ s(t) = t^2 \quad \text{where t is the time} $$
If we graphed this function, we&amp;rsquo;d get a parabola:
 Now, let&amp;rsquo;s graph its velocity. You can do it manually, but if you try to feel it, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that since as the time goes by the displacement keeps on increasing faster and faster, the velocity could increase linearly.</description>

      <description>Finding the length of a curve After misunderstanding a question in physics, I thought I had to calculate the length of a curved trajectory (ie. the distance) instead of just the straight line (ie. the displacement). Turns out it was the easy option, but I now wanted to know how to get the length of a curve. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;d just be summing up an infinite number of straight lines, which is almost exactly what integration is&amp;hellip;</description>
